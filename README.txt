In the wp-admin, there will be a new page for customizing this plugin's settings. The first setting will be for
customizing the dashboard used for results.
If you are not a reseller and do not have a dashboard, [the default](http://admin.localsitesubmit.com/) is used.

If you have a custom dashboard set, make sure it is correct. Try running the test without a customized dashboard.
